### Language learning keyboards for iOS

**Scribe-iOS** is a pack of iOS and iPadOS keyboards for language learners. Features include translation **`(beta)`**, verb conjugation and word annotation that give users the tools needed to communicate with confidence.

Scribe is fully open-source and does not collect usage data or ask for system access. Feature data is sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and stored in-app, meaning Scribe is a highly responsive experience that does not require an internet connection.

See the [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16ld_rCbwJCiAdRrfhF-Fq9Wm_ciHCbk_HCzGQs6TB1Q/edit?usp=sharing) for [Wikidata Data Reuse Days 2022](https://diff.wikimedia.org/event/wikidata-data-reuse-days-2022/) for a full description of the project. Those interested in helping are welcome to join us in the [community discussions](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/discussions)!

# Supported Languages [`‚áß`](#contents) <a id="supported-languages"></a>

Scribe's goal is functional, feature-rich keyboards for all languages. Check [Scribe-iOS/Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/tree/main/Data) for queries for currently supported languages and those that have substantial data on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Also see the [`new keyboard`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+keyboard%22) label in the [Issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues) for keyboards that are currently in progress or being discussed, and [suggest a new keyboard](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new+keyboard&template=new_keyboard.yml&title=Add+%3Clanguage%3E+keyboard) if you don't see it being worked on already!

The following table shows the supported languages and the amount of data available for each on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/):

| Languages  |   Nouns | Verbs | Translations\* | Adjectives‚Ä† | Prepositions‚Ä° |
| :--------- | ------: | ----: | -------------: | ----------: | ------------: |
| French     |  15,788 | 1,246 |         67,652 |           - |             - |
| German     |  28,089 | 3,130 |         67,652 |           - |           187 |
| Italian    |     783 |    71 |         67,652 |           - |             - |
| Portuguese |   4,662 |   189 |         67,652 |           - |             - |
| Russian    | 194,394 |    11 |         67,652 |           - |            12 |
| Spanish    |   9,452 | 2,062 |         67,652 |           - |             - |
| Swedish    |  41,187 | 4,138 |         67,652 |           - |             - |

`*` Given the current **`beta`** status where words are machine translated.

`‚Ä†` Adjective-preposition support is in progress [(see issue)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/86).

`‚Ä°` Only for languages for which preposition annotation is needed.

Updates to the above data can be done using [Data/update_data.py](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/tree/main/Data/update_data.py).

# Setup [`‚áß`](#contents) <a id="setup"></a>

Users access Scribe language keyboards through the following:

- Download Scribe from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/scribe-language-keyboards/id1596613886)
- Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Keyboards -> Add New Keyboard
- Select Scribe and choose from the available language keyboards
- When typing press `üåê` to select keyboards

# Keyboard Features [`‚áß`](#contents) <a id="keyboard-features"></a>

Keyboard features are accessed via the `Scribe key` at the top left of any Scribe keyboard. Pressing this key gives the user three new selectable options: `Translate`, `Conjugate` and `Plural` in the keyboard's language. These keys allow for words to be queried and inserted into the text field followed by a space.

**Current features include:**

### ‚Ä¢ Translation [`‚áß`](#contents) <a id="translation"></a>

The **`beta`** `Translate` feature can translate single words or phrases from English into the language of the current keyboard when the `return` key is pressed.

Those interested in improving this feature can see the [Translation project](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/projects/1). The goal is that `Translate` will provide options for entered words where a user can use grammatical categories and synonyms to select the best option [(see issue)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/49). Then the feature will expand to allow translations from system and chosen languages. More advanced methods will be planned once this feature is out of **`beta`**.

As of now translations ([P5972](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P5972), [Q7553](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7553)) are not widely available on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) [(see issue)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/40). The current functionality is thus based on [ü§ó Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) machine translations of words queried from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). The ultimate goal is for the translations and synonyms to all be directly queried.

### ‚Ä¢ Verb Conjugation [`‚áß`](#contents) <a id="verb-conjugation"></a>

With the `Conjugate` feature, a user is presented with the grammar charts for an entered verb instead of the keyboard. Pressing an example in the charts inserts the chosen conjugation into the text field.

### ‚Ä¢ Noun Plurals [`‚áß`](#contents) <a id="noun-plurals"></a>

The `Plural` feature allows a user to enter a noun and then insert its plural into the text field when the `return` key is pressed.

### ‚Ä¢ Word Annotation [`‚áß`](#contents) <a id="word-annotation"></a>

Scribe further annotates words in the command bar to help users understand the context of what they're typing. Annotations are displayed once a user has typed a given word and pressed space or by pressing the `Scribe key` while it is selected. The hope is that annotation will help a user remember grammar rules even when not using Scribe.

#### Nouns

Scribe annotates nouns in the command bar according to the following conventions:

- Feminine: colored red üü• and marked with (F)
- Masculine: colored blue üü¶ and marked with (M)
- Common: colored purple üü™ and marked with (C)
- Neutral: colored green üü© and marked with (N)
- Plural: colored orange üüß and marked with (PL)
- More than one: marked with all their forms

The above form abbreviations are translated into their equivalents in the keyboard's language.

#### Prepositions

Scribe also annotates the grammatical cases (accusative, dative, etc) of prepositions in the command bar if there is a relation in the given language.

### ‚Ä¢ Base Functionality [`‚áß`](#contents) <a id="base-functionality"></a>

The goal is for Scribe to have all the functionality of system keyboards. See the [Base Keyboard Features project](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/projects/6) if interested in helping.

# Language Practice [`‚áß`](#contents) <a id="language-practice"></a>

A future feature of Scribe is language practice within the app itself. Scribe presents users with information that is directly relevant to their current struggles with a second language. This information can be saved in-app and used to create personalized lessons such as flashcards to reinforce the information that Scribe has provided. Work on this feature will be completed in the [language practice project](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/projects/7).

# Contributing [`‚áß`](#contents) <a id="contributing"></a>

Work that is in progress or could be implemented is tracked in the [Issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues) and [Projects](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/projects).

### Data Edits

Scribe does not accept direct edits to the grammar JSON files as they are sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Edits can be discussed and the queries themselves will be changed and ran before an update. If there is a problem with one of the files, then the fix should be made on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and not on Scribe. Feel free to let us know that edits have been made by [opening a data issue](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/new?assignees=&labels=data&template=data_wikidata.yml) and we'll be happy to integrate them!
