### Scribe language keyboards for iOS

**Scribe-iOS** is a pack of iOS and iPadOS power user keyboards for language learners. Features include translation **`(beta)`**, verb conjugation and noun annotation that give users the tools needed to communicate with confidence. German and Spanish are currently the only supported languages, but the Scribe team has interest in creating keyboards for all languages of interest.

Data for Scribe keyboards is sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/), with [WDQS](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_tutorial) queries being written to produce JSON files for easy reference. Being fully open-source, Scribe prioritizes user privacy and doesn't ask for any data or system access.

# Setup [`‚áß`](#contents) <a id="setup"></a>

Users access Scribe language keyboards through the following:

- Download Scribe from the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/)
- Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Keyboards -> Add New Keyboard
- Select from the available Scribe keyboards
- When typing press `üåê` to select keyboards

# Features [`‚áß`](#contents) <a id="features"></a>

Scribe keyboard features are accessed via the `Scribe key` at the top left of any Scribe keyboard. Pressing this key gives the user three new selectable options: `Translate`, `Conjugate` and `Plural`. These buttons allow for words to be queried and inserted into the text field. An extra space is inserted after so that these features function like auto-suggestions. Current features include:

### Translation

The **`beta`** `Translate` feature can translate single words or phrases from English into the language of the current keyboard when the `‚Üµ` key is pressed. The goal is to first expand this feature to allow for translations from system and chosen languages. Later this feature will provide options for entered words where a user can use grammatical categories and synonyms to select the best option. More advanced methods will be planned and added once this feature is out of **`beta`**.

As of now translations ([P5972](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P5972), [Q7553](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7553)) are not widely available on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). The current functionality is thus based on [ü§ó Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) machine translations of words queried from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Edits to translations.json files are welcome while this feature is in **`beta`**, but the goal is for translations to be directly queried. Furthermore, translating verbs currently requires the user to input `to VERB` so that there is a distinction between verbs and other word forms. This requirement will be removed when later versions change the keyboard display to provide the user with multiple options across grammatical categories.

### Verb Conjugation

With the `Conjugate` feature, a user is presented with the grammar charts for an entered verb instead of the keyboard. Pressing an example in the charts inserts the chosen conjugation into the text field.

### Noun Plurals

The `Plural` feature allows a user to enter a noun and then insert its plural when the `‚Üµ` key is pressed.

</p>
-->

### Noun Annotation

Scribe further annotates nouns in the preview label according to the following conventions:

- Feminine nouns are colored red üü• and marked with (F)
- Masculine nouns are colored blue üü¶ and marked with (M)
- Neutral nouns are colored green üü© and marked with (N)
- Plural nouns are colored orange üüß and marked with (PL)
- Nouns meeting more than one of the above criteria are black ‚¨õ and marked with all their forms

Annotations are displayed once a user has typed a noun and pressed space or by pressing the `Scribe key` while a noun is selected.

</p>
-->

### Preposition Annotation

Scribe also annotates the grammatical cases of prepositions in the preview label if there is a relation in the given language. Annotations are displayed once a user has typed a preposition and pressed space or by pressing the `Scribe key` while a preposition is selected.

</p>

### System Keyboard Functionality

The goal is that Scribe keyboards have all the functionality of system keyboards.

# To-Do [`‚áß`](#contents) <a id="to-do"></a>

Please see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in contributing to this project. Work that is in progress or could be implemented includes:

## Functionality

- Code cleaning

- Baseline fixes to translations.json files

- Releasing Scribe-iOS MVP

- Adding autocorrect functionality [(see issue)]()

- Adding autocomplete functionality [(see issue)]()

- Fix issue with `selectKeyboard` button not being able to be long-pressed after another key press [(see issue)]()

- Fixing hold-to-select character implementation so it's one function (and maybe that the user needs to continue to hold) [(see issue)]()

- Refactoring Scribe-iOS so that it's more modular [(see issue)]()

- Adding support for more languages to Scribe-iOS [(see issues)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues)

- Creating testing files and a ci process for Scribe-iOS [(see issue)]()

- Localizing Scribe-iOS across various languages and regions [(see issues)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues)

- Moving data files to a new repository in [scribe-org](https://github.com/scribe-org) and accessing them remotely to allow Android and extension access [(see issue)]()

  - This would likely best be implemented via a Python package that allows users to access data within JSON files stored in the package

  - The creation of a repository with grammar rules for Scribe languages would be a valuable resource for Scribe and the open-source community

- Planning and implementing baseline documentation for Scribe [(see issue)]()

- Discussing further grammatical information that can be displayed to the user in the preview bar that could help with language learning [(see issue)]()

- Allowing a user to press or long hold the preview label for further information on what's being displayed [(see issue)]()

- Adding undo button functionality for iPads and iPhones [(see issue)]()

- Discussing and implementing long press functionality for the `Conjugate` feature [(see issue)]()

  - This would allow users to do certain actions like selecting just participles or the full conjugation with helper verbs

- Allowing certain features to be changed in the system settings and/or in the Scribe app [(see issue)]()

- Change the select noun and preposition annotation features to not require a the `Scribe key` to be pressed [(see issue)]()

- Change the Scribe interface buttons to default UIButtons from plain so that versions lower than iOS 15 can be supported [(see issue)]()

- Devising and implementing a way to effectively chain Scribe commands together [(see issue)]()

  - For example: providing `Conjugate` as an option for verb translations when `Translate` provides selectable options

## Appearance

- Create a version of the `Scribe key` that is appropriately rendered across devices [(see issue)]()

- Fix transition from portrait to landscape so that height is re-rendered [(see issue)]()

  - This is likely caused by a missing parent-child relationship for `keyboardView`

- Create a proper bezier path implementation of hold-to-select characters including keys popping up when being pressed and then removing key pressed coloration [(see issue)]()

- Improving the appearance of the Scribe app in [ViewController.swift](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/Scribe/ViewController.swift) including UI to make activating keyboards easier [(see issue)]()

- Improving the adaptability of [AppScreen.storyboard](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/Scribe/Base.lproj/AppScreen.storyboard) and [LaunchScreen.storyboard](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/Scribe/Base.lproj/LaunchScreen.storyboard) to make them work better across devices [(see issue)]()

- Edits to [KeyboardViewController.swift](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/Keyboards/KeyboardsBase/KeyboardViewController.swift) and [Keyboard.xib](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/Keyboards/KeyboardsBase/Keyboard.xib) files to make Scribe keyboard elements dynamically sized [(see issue)]()

- Edits to [Keyboard.xib](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/Keyboards/KeyboardsBase/Keyboard.xib) to provide language specific UI elements based on grammatical needs [(see issue)]()

- Refining colors in both light and dark mode implementations [(see issue)]()

- Adding key shading to keyboards [(see issue)]()

- Have the space bar read the name of the keyboard when it's switched to but not selected from the drop down [(see issue)]()

- Make the cursor within the preview bar blink when the field is active [(see issue)]()

- Adding a feature where the Scribe UI can be hidden (including an element to show the UI again) [(see issue)]()

  - Long holding keys for alternate characters would need to be edited to make sure that the alternates would still be fully within the keyboard view

## Data

Aside from translation JSONs, Scribe does not accept direct edits to the grammar JSON files as they are sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Edits can be discussed and the queries themselves will be changed and ran before an update. If there is a problem with one of the files, then the fix should be made on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and not on Scribe. Known data issues include:

- Fixing errors in the `Translate` feature's JSON files while it is in **`beta`** [(see issue)]()

- Expanding the availability of translations in [Wikidata lexicographical data](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Lexicographical_data) and reworking the `Translate` query process to access them [(see issue)]()

  - Scribe will not accept edits to any JSON files when this task is finished

- Adding a way to indicate which nouns in Spanish switch their articles to avoid difficult pronunciations [(see issue)]()

  - For example: agua (water) is feminine, but it's "el agua" to avoid "la agua" (but still "las aguas")

- Many German verbs do not have auxiliary verbs on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) meaning that their full perfect conjugations cannot be displayed [(see issue)]()

- Adding missing verb conjugations to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) [(see issue)]()

  - Missing values are marked as `""` in verbs.json files

- Standardizing the conjugation properties for Spanish verbs [(see issue)]()

- Adding data to allow for the long hold or drop down of verb info in the `Conjugate` feature that can show what case is used for the verb as well as the prepositions that follow it [(see issue)]()
