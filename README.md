### Scribe language keyboards for iOS

**Scribe-iOS** is a pack of iOS system keyboards that colors nouns typed in messaging apps based on their gender. The keyboards give users the confidence that they are using words in an appropriate context, and further helps language learners remember word genders through color association. Planned functionality includes in-chat verb conjugation and other power user features.

Being fully open-source, Scribe prioritizes user privacy by not accessing any user data. German and Spanish are currently the only supported languages, but the Scribe team has interest in creating keyboards for all languages of interest.

Please see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in contributing to this project. Work that is in progress or could be implemented includes:

- Creating an MVP

- Expanding Scribe's support for current languages by adding words and their genders

<!--

- Adding support for more languages to Scribe-iOS [(see issues)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues)

- Planning the potential implementation of a verb conjugation command (see issue)

  - Example: typing /fps chosen_infinitive could conjugate the verb to first person singular

- Planning the potential implementation of a plural command (see issue)

  - Example: typing /pl chosen_noun could provide the plural for the noun

- Adding iPadOS specific functionality (see issue)

- Add dark mode functionality (see issue)

-->

- Moving grammar files to a new repository in [scribe-org](https://github.com/scribe-org) and accessing them remotely to allow Android and extension access

  - The creation of a repository with grammar rules for Scribe languages would be a valuable resource for Scribe and the open-source community

- Converting Scribe languages into downloadable packs within the app
