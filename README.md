### Scribe language keyboards for iOS

**Scribe-iOS** is a pack of iOS and iPadOS power user keyboards for language learners. Features include verb conjugation and gender based coloration of nouns that give users the tools needed to communicate with confidence. Being fully open-source, Scribe prioritizes user privacy and doesn't ask for access to any user data. German and Spanish are currently the only supported languages, but the Scribe team has interest in creating keyboards for all languages of interest.

- Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Keyboards -> Add New Keyboard
- Select from the available Scribe keyboards
- When typing press üåê to select keyboards

## Grammar Queries

Scribe allows users to programmatically query words based on grammar rules. Typing backslash and a chosen command allows the user to type a given word in the preview bar. The desired word form is then inserted with a press of the return key.

Examples of this include:

- /pl provides the plural of a noun
- /fps provides the first person singular of a verb

An extra space is inserted after the queried word so that this feature functions similar to auto-suggestions. The behavior of the `/` key is further changed so that pressing it switches to the alphabetic keys.

## Noun-Gender Coloration

Scribe colors nouns according to the following conventions:

- Feminine nouns are colored red üü• and marked with (F)
- Masculine nouns are colored blue üü¶ and marked with (M)
- Neutral nouns are colored green üü© and marked with (N)
- Plural nouns are colored orange üüß and marked with (PL)
- Nouns with more than one gender are multicolored and marked with all genders using commas

## iOS and iPadOS System Keyboard Functionality

The goal is for Scribe keyboards have all the functionality of system keyboards.

# To-Do [`‚Ü©`](#contents) <a id="to-do"></a>

Please see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in contributing to this project. Work that is in progress or could be implemented includes:

- Expanding Scribe's support for current languages by adding to the [language files](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS)

  - Nouns added should have their gender and plural

  - Verbs added should have all conjugations

  - Pull requests are more than welcome!

- Selecting a noun would display its gender in the preview bar (see issue)

- Localizing the Scribe app across various languages and regions

- Adding support for more languages to Scribe-iOS (see issues)

- Allowing words to be colored within preview texts such that the user will consistently see their gender (see issue)

- Exploring the possibility of doing in-messenger translations (see issue)

  - Example: type /tr and entering a word in the preview bar would bring up a selectable list of translations over the keyboard

  - The base functionality would translate from the system language into the language of the keyboard, with the ability to choose a language from which translations would be made being ideal

- Moving grammar files to a new repository in [scribe-org](https://github.com/scribe-org) and accessing them remotely to allow Android and extension access (see issue)

  - This would likely best be implemented via a Python package that allows users to access data within JSON files stored in the package

  - The creation of a repository with grammar rules for Scribe languages would be a valuable resource for Scribe and the open-source community

- Converting Scribe keyboards into downloadable packs within the app (see issue)

  - This would help keep the app size to a minimum

- Make the shift key change color after being pressed (see issue)

  - Note: we want ‚áß to switch to `‚¨Ü` and ‚á™ to also be filled in

- Creating a UI field where grammar queries would take place when triggered (see issue)

  - This would allow for the removal of parentheses around words that the user wants to convert

- Make the space bar read the name of the keyboard when it's switched to (see issue)

- Giving users the ability to map grammar queries to their own desired commands (see issue)
