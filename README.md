### Scribe language keyboards for iOS

**Scribe-iOS** is a pack of iOS and iPadOS power user keyboards for language learners. Features include translation **`(beta)`**, verb conjugation and annotation of nouns that give users the tools needed to communicate with confidence. Being fully open-source, Scribe prioritizes user privacy and doesn't ask for any data or system access.

Data for Scribe keyboards is sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/), with [WDQS](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_tutorial) queries being written to produce JSON files for easy reference. The [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) query and formatting files for each keyboard are found in the `DataPrep` directory or each keyboard in [Scribe-iOS/Keyboards](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/tree/main/Keyboards). German and Spanish are currently the only supported languages, but the Scribe team has interest in creating keyboards for all languages of interest.

# Setup [`‚Ü©`](#contents) <a id="setup"></a>

Users access Scribe language keyboards through the following:

- Download Scribe from the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/)
- Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Keyboards -> Add New Keyboard
- Select from the available Scribe keyboards
- When typing press üåê to select keyboards

# Features [`‚Ü©`](#contents) <a id="features"></a>

Scribe keyboard features are accessed via the `Scribe key` at the top left of any Scribe keyboard. Pressing this key gives the user three new selectable options: `Translate`, `Conjugate` and `Plural`. These buttons allow for words to be queried and inserted into the text field. An extra space is inserted after so that these features function like auto-suggestions. Current features include:

### Translation

The **`beta`** `Translate` feature can translate single words or phrases from English into the language of the current keyboard when the `‚Üµ` key is pressed. The goal is to first expand this feature to allow for translations from system and chosen languages, then to provide options for entered words where a user can use grammatical categories and synonyms to select the best option, and then finally to explore api translation implementations.

As of now translations ([P5972](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P5972), [Q7553](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7553)) are not widely available on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). The current functionality is thus based on [ü§ó Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) machine translated words queried from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Edits to translations.json files are welcome while this feature is in **`beta`**, but the goal is for translations to be directly queried. Furthermore, translating verbs currently requires the user to input `to VERB` so that there is a distinction between verbs and other word forms.

### Verb Conjugation

With the `Conjugate` feature, a user is presented with the grammar charts for an entered verb instead of the keyboard. Pressing an example in the charts inserts the chosen conjugation into the text field.

### Noun Plurals

The `Plural` feature allows a user to enter a noun and then insert its plural when the `‚Üµ` key is pressed.

</p>
-->

### Noun Annotation

Scribe further annotates nouns in the preview label according to the following conventions:

- Feminine nouns are colored red üü• and marked with (F)
- Masculine nouns are colored blue üü¶ and marked with (M)
- Neutral nouns are colored green üü© and marked with (N)
- Plural nouns are colored orange üüß and marked with (PL)
- Nouns meeting more than one of the above criteria are black ‚¨õ and marked with all forms

Annotations are displayed once a user has typed a noun and pressed space or by pressing the `Scribe key` while a noun is selected.

### iOS and iPadOS System Keyboard Functionality

The goal is that Scribe keyboards have all the functionality of system keyboards.

# To-Do [`‚Ü©`](#contents) <a id="to-do"></a>

Please see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in contributing to this project. Work that is in progress or could be implemented includes:

## Functionality

- Adding iPad keyboard layout support and fixing key appearance

- Adding support for landscape orientation

- Adding labels to keys that don't have unicode character representations

- Allowing for keys to be long pressed for alternate keys options

- Improving appearance and adding settings features to the Scribe app

- Releasing Scribe-iOS MVP

- Adding support for more languages to Scribe-iOS [(see issues)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues)

- Creating testing files and a ci process for Scribe-iOS [(see issue)]()

- Localizing Scribe-iOS across various languages and regions [(see issues)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues)

- Moving grammar files to a new repository in [scribe-org](https://github.com/scribe-org) and accessing them remotely to allow Android and extension access [(see issue)]()

  - This would likely best be implemented via a Python package that allows users to access data within JSON files stored in the package

  - The creation of a repository with grammar rules for Scribe languages would be a valuable resource for Scribe and the open-source community

- Converting Scribe keyboards into downloadable packs within the app [(see issue)]()

  - This would help keep the app size to a minimum

- Planning and implementing baseline documentation for Scribe [(see issue)]()

## Appearance

- Edits to Keyboard.xib files to make keyboards more responsive and to provide language specific UI based on grammatical needs [(see issue)]()

- Make the shift key character change color after being pressed [(see issue)]()

  - Note: we want ‚áß to switch to `‚¨Ü` and ‚á™ to also be filled in

- Fixes to the dark mode implementation [(see issue)]()

- Adding key shading to keyboards [(see issue)]()

- Make the space bar read the name of the keyboard when it's switched to [(see issue)]()

- Make the cursor within the preview bar blink when the field is active [(see issue)]()

- Adding a feature where the Scribe UI can be hidden with an element to show the UI again [(see issue)]()

  - Long holding keys for alternate characters would need to be edited to make sure that the alternates would still be fully within the keyboard view

## Data

Aside from translation JSONs, Scribe does not accept direct edits to the grammar JSON files as they are sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Edits can be discussed and the queries themselves will be changed and ran before an update. If there is a problem with one of the files, then the fix should be made on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and not on Scribe. Known data issues include:

- Expanding the availability of translations in [Wikidata lexicographical data](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Lexicographical_data) and reworking the `Translate` feature to access them [(see issue)]()

  - Scribe will not accept edits to any JSON files when this task is finished

- Many German verbs do not have auxiliary verbs meaning that their full perfect conjugations cannot be displayed [(see issue)]()

- Adding missing verb conjugations to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) [(see issue)]()

  - Missing values are marked as `""` in verbs.json files
