### Scribe language keyboards for iOS

**Scribe-iOS** is a pack of iOS system keyboards that colors nouns typed in messaging clients based on their gender. The keyboards give users the confidence that they are using words in an appropriate context, and further helps language learners remember word genders through color association.

Scribe colors nouns according to the following conventions:

- All feminine nouns are colored red ðŸŸ¥
- All masculine nouns are colored blue ðŸŸ¦
- All neutral nouns are colored green ðŸŸ©
- All plural nouns are colored orange ðŸŸ§
- Nouns with more than one gender are multicolored

Languages that are currently supported are German and Spanish, but the Scribe team has interest in creating keyboards for all languages of interest. Scribe also prioritizes user privacy by not accessing any user data. Fully open-source, Scribe aims to add functionality to create keyboards for iOS power users and language learners.

Please see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in contributing to this project. Work that is in progress or could be implemented includes:

- Creating an MVP

- Expanding Scribe's support for current languages by adding words and their genders

<!--

- Adding support for more languages to Scribe-iOS [(see issues)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues)

- Planning the potential implementation of a verb conjugation command (see issue)

  - Example: typing /fps chosen_infinitive could conjugate the verb to first person singular

- Planning the potential implementation of a noun plural command (see issue)

  - Example: typing /pl chosen_noun could provide the plural for the noun

- Adding iPadOS specific functionality (see issue)

- Add dark mode functionality (see issue)

-->

- Moving grammar files to a new repository in [scribe-org](https://github.com/scribe-org) and accessing them remotely to allow Android and extension access

  - The creation of a repository with grammar rules for Scribe languages would be a valuable resource for Scribe and the open-source community
