### Scribe language keyboards for iOS

**Scribe-iOS** is a pack of iOS and iPadOS power user keyboards for language learners. Features include translation (beta), verb conjugation and annotation of nouns that give users the tools needed to communicate with confidence. Being fully open-source, Scribe prioritizes user privacy and doesn't ask for any data or system access.

Data for Scribe keyboards is sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/), with [WDQS](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_tutorial) queries being written to produce JSON files for easy reference. The [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) query and formatting files for each keyboard are found in the `DataPrep` directory or each keyboard in [Scribe-iOS/Keyboards](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/tree/main/Keyboards). German and Spanish are currently the only supported languages, but the Scribe team has interest in creating keyboards for all languages of interest.

# Setup [`‚Ü©`](#contents) <a id="setup"></a>

Users access Scribe language keyboards through the following:

- Download Scribe from the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/)
- Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Keyboards -> Add New Keyboard
- Select from the available Scribe keyboards
- When typing press üåê to select keyboards

# Features [`‚Ü©`](#contents) <a id="features"></a>

Scribe keyboard features are accessed via the `Scribe key` at the top left of any Scribe keyboard. Pressing this key gives the user three new selectable options: `Translate`, `Conjugate` and `Plural`. These buttons allow for words to be queried and inserted into the text field. An extra space is inserted after so that these features function like auto-suggestions. Current features include:

### Translation

The **`beta`** `Translate` feature can translate single words from English into the language of the current keyboard when the `‚Üµ` key is pressed. The goal is to first expand this feature to allow for translations from system and chosen languages, and then explore multi word translations.

### Verb Conjugation

With the `Conjugate` feature, a user is presented with the grammar charts for an entered verb instead of the keyboard. Pressing an example in the charts inserts the chosen conjugation into the text field.

### Noun Plurals

The `Plural` feature allows a user to enter a noun and then insert its plural when the `‚Üµ` key is pressed.

</p>
-->

### Noun Annotation

Scribe further annotates nouns in the preview label according to the following conventions:

- Feminine nouns are colored red üü• and marked with (F)
- Masculine nouns are colored blue üü¶ and marked with (M)
- Neutral nouns are colored green üü© and marked with (N)
- Plural nouns are colored orange üüß and marked with (PL)
- Nouns meeting more than one of the above criteria are black ‚¨õ and marked with all forms

Annotations are displayed once a user has typed a noun and pressed space or by pressing the `Scribe key` while a noun is selected.

### iOS and iPadOS System Keyboard Functionality

The goal is that Scribe keyboards have all the functionality of system keyboards.

# To-Do [`‚Ü©`](#contents) <a id="to-do"></a>

Please see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in contributing to this project. Specifically: Scribe does not accept direct edits to the grammar JSON files as they are sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Edits can be discussed and the queries themselves will be changed and ran before an update. If there is a problem with one of the files, then the fix should be made on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and not on Scribe.

Work that is in progress or could be implemented includes:

## Functionality

- Using Wikidata to create JSON files for verbs and translations

- Adding support for more languages to Scribe-iOS [(see issues)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues)

- Creating testing files and a ci process for Scribe-iOS [(see issue)]()

- Localizing the Scribe app across various languages and regions [(see issues)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues)

- Moving grammar files to a new repository in [scribe-org](https://github.com/scribe-org) and accessing them remotely to allow Android and extension access [(see issue)]()

  - This would likely best be implemented via a Python package that allows users to access data within JSON files stored in the package

  - The creation of a repository with grammar rules for Scribe languages would be a valuable resource for Scribe and the open-source community

- Converting Scribe keyboards into downloadable packs within the app [(see issue)]()

  - This would help keep the app size to a minimum

- Planning and implementing baseline documentation for Scribe [(see issue)]()

## Appearance

- Make the shift key character change color after being pressed [(see issue)]()

  - Note: we want ‚áß to switch to `‚¨Ü` and ‚á™ to also be filled in

- Fixes to the dark mode implementation [(see issue)]()

- Make the space bar read the name of the keyboard when it's switched to [(see issue)]()

- Make the cursor within the preview bar blink when the field is active [(see issue)]()

- Adding a feature where the Scribe UI can be hidden and replaced with a system keyboard with an element to show the UI again [(see issue)]()
