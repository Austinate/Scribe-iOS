Scribe is a pack of iOS and iPadOS keyboards for language learners. It provides features to help users remember grammar rules so they can effectively communicate without needing to leave their keyboard.

Included Languages

French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish.

Current Features

- The (beta) Translate feature can translate single words or phrases from English into the language of the current keyboard.

- With the Conjugate feature, a user is presented with the grammar charts for an entered verb instead of the keyboard. Pressing an example in the charts inserts the chosen conjugation into the text field.

- The Plural feature allows a user to enter a noun and then insert its plural into the text field.

- Scribe further annotates noun genders and preposition cases in the command bar to help users understand the context of what they're typing. Annotations are displayed once a user has typed a given word and pressed space or by pressing the Scribe key while it is selected.

Being fully open source, the Scribe team loves to get both feedback and contributions. Please don't hesitate to visit us at https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS!
